#### Side Notes
Obstacles we ran into that we plan to fix in the future:
- Get the google API to populate when we put any postalcode in the search.
- Get the eBay API to generate a link of the searched results.
- Clean up the code and algin everything to look professional. 
- In the future dynamically create tables for the resutls.
